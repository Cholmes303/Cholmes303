# About Me

I am Cristian Holmes, a student at Warren Tech, studying cybersecurity and computer science. I took interest in my study in 2023 and started my journey with Warren Tech. I have done many coding projects that I will add to my public repositories. I started learning coding within Python and have stuck with it since. Some projects I have done are password crackers, network tracers, and graphing with the Python library matplotlib. 

## Hobbies
I enjoy a lot of different things. I have a great interest for building computers ever since I built my own. I love music and play piano and guitar. I enjoy cooking and trying different foods as well as seeing the world. I play lots of golf in the summer. 

## Interests
I am incredibly interested in cybersecurity and plan on going to CU Denver or Grand Canyon University to further my study. Ever since I built my own computer I have been obsessed with learning about new hardware, mainly CPUs and GPUs, that come out. This includes the crazy GPU shortage with the Geforce 50 series launch. I am always interested in learning more. 

## Skills
I have not had a job within tech yet, however I have built many skills from my two jobs I have worked as well as school. I worked at Chick-Fil-A which taught me how to collaborate and communicate effectively with coworkers to accomplish a task efficiently. When working at Home Depot I learned how to problem solve ways to get work done on my own without others. Being a student at Warren Tech has taught me many critical thinking skills when it comes to coding as well as collaboration with others to overcome a problem.
